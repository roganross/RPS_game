README - Rock, Paper, Scissors 

DESCRIPTION

    Rock, Paper, Scissors is an adaptation of the physical childhood
    game of the same name, translated onto the UC Funkit 4 (UCFK4). It 
    is to be played between two players with separate UCFK4s. The game 
    requires a basic understanding of the concept of the game and a
    basic knowledge of the UCFK4's peripherals. These will be explained
    in the following sections.

RULES OF ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS

    Rock, Paper, Scissors is a simple game in which each player chooses
    one of three actions using the action's first letter.
    The possible actions are:

        1. Rock - 'R'.
        2. Paper - 'P'
        3. Scissors - 'S'

    The rules for determining the winner are as follows:

        - Rock smashes scissors, so rock wins against scissors.
        - Scissors cuts paper, so scissors win against paper.
        - Paper covers rock, so paper wins against rock.
        - If both players choose the same shape, the game is a tie.

HOW TO PLAY ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS

    Following the rules stated above, the UCFK4s navigation switch can be
    used to play Rock, Paper, Scissors. The navswitch layout is as follows:
    'North' is Paper, 'East' is Scissors, 'West' is Rock and 'Push' is send 
    action. A visualisation of the layout of the navigation switch is as 
    follows:

                  Paper 'P'
                     /\
                     ||
                    _||_
              ____ /    \ ____    
    Rock 'R' <____  SEND  ____> Scissors 'S'
                   \____/
    _______________________________ <- Bottom of UCFK4

    Both players must choose a action and send them. Once both have been 
    sent the actions will be subjected to the rules and the result
    of the interaction will be displayed.

    The users will then be prompted to play again. Using the navigation
    switch they may choose 'Y' for yes or 'N' for no. 'Y' can be selected
    by pressing 'North' on the navigation switch or 'N' can be selected by
    pressing 'South' on the navigation switch. The input can be sent by
    pushing the navigation switch. A visual representation of this is as 
    follows:
    
                   Yes 'Y'
                     /\
                     ||
                    _||_
                   /    \    
                  | SEND |
                   \_  _/
                     ||
                     ||
                     \/
                   No 'N'

    If both players agree to play again the game will reset. If not, the UCFK4s 
    displays will turn off. The players will continue to play until either of 
    the players say they do not want to play again.
